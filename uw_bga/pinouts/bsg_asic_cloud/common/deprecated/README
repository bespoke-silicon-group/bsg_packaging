pinout:

- to_assembly_house_tapeout_july_2019: This directory contains the files we
  sent to the assembly house for packaging the ASICs from the July 2019
  tapeouts. They contain a bug fix for bump locations that has since been fixed
  therefore these fixes are no longer required and have been deprecated.
