    - Shape image
    - Bond diagrams for signal/vdd/v18/vss/inner_ring/all_combined
    - CSV files for coordinates

Recreating bond diagrams:
    - Prerequisite: python3, ImageMagiks
    - Run make

Special note for bug fix:
    - Note that not all wires are bonded in this version. uw_bga_gf12_all_combined.csv is different from uw_bga_gf12.csv, former one should be sent to assemply house. If bug fix is not needed, uw_bga_gf12_all_combined.csv should be removed and use uw_bga_gf12.csv directly.

Port to new process node checklist:
    - Update "Width", "Height", "Die X" and "Die y" coordinates for new bond-pad on die in uw_bga_<process>.csv. Note that the ordering of pads in this csv file is clockwise, in the order of E->S->W->N.
    - Copy and paste newly updated rows into uw_bga_<process>_signal.csv, uw_bga_<process>_vdd.csv, uw_bga_<process>_v18.csv and uw_bga_<process>_vss.csv
    - Update PDF build sheet and orientation image accordingly
