- **pcb**:     design collatoral; inputs and outputs to BGA substrate designer; 
           mostly for curiousity but also potentially for modelling the package, clarifications, or modifying the substrate

- **pinouts**: this is what most chip designers will spend most of their time looking at

See the first  <a href="http://bjump.org/manycore/">ten-core RISC-V chip</a> in history, 5x5mm 180nm TSMC BSG-X, which used this package!


See the first  <a href="http://bjump.org/manycore/">511-core RISC-V chip</a> in history, 5x5mm 16nm TSMC Celerity, which used this pinout!

See the  <a href="http://bjump.org/pics/outerspace_package_photo.png">Outerspace chip,</a>,  3x3mm 40nm TSMC OuterSpace, which used this package!
