A package is generally a passive component with physical geometry, 
basically a set of electrically connected substrate bond pad (SBP) locations, 
and corresponding connections to pins or balls. 

It does not necessarily say anything about the whether those pins
are inputs or outputs, and it could change based on the use of the package.

We call a package combined with this information a "pinout". This 
directory is for holding pinout-specific files.

The two current pinouts are:

- bsg_one:   preliminary version; do not use
- bsg_two:   **wirebond** BGA using the BGA_332 socket and final padring for BGA_332
- bsg_three: **flipchip** BGA from DARPA CRAFT program
