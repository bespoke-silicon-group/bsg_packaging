A package is generally a passive component with physical geometry, 
basically a set of electrically connected substrate bond pad (SBP) locations, 
and corresponding connections to pins or balls. 

It does not necessarily say anything about the whether those pins
are inputs or outputs, and it could change based on the use of the package.

We call a package combined with this information a "pinout". This 
directory is for holding pinout-specific files.

Currently, we just have the bsg_one pinout, and bsg_two.
