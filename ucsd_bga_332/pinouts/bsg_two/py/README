This script is used to help generate the tcl files found in ../tcl. This script takes in a csv
file where each line is the following:

    Pad Name, Center Coordinate (in um), Chip Side [top, bottom, left, right]

The script will take that csv file and create a list of 'set_pin_physcal_constraints' tcl commands
which go in ../tcl/pin_pad_physical_constraints.tcl. It will also spit out long lines with all the
filler cells it inserted between pads to make sure their centers lined up. This line are supposed
to go into ../tcl/physical_only_cells_creation_file.tcl. You will need to change the <PAD FILLER #>
at the end of each one of these lines with the correct pad fille name for your process.

At the top of the script, in the section labeled 'USER VARIABLES' you can set the width of the
various pads as well as the die coordinates. You can also rotate the pads clock wise and generate
a new CSV after rotation.
