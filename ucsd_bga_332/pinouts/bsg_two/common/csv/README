This directory contains files for handoff to the assembly file.
These are a baseline that was used for our TSMC 180 manycore chip.

Generally, you would start by dialing in your chip pad-ring geometry information
into the .xlsx file.

To use for your chip:

1. you would modify the Die X and Die Y coordinates for your own pad ring's pads

2. revisit the PLL power domain bonding (marked in red) per your PLL's requirements



FILES:

ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate_calculator.xlsx: calculator for generating wirebond geometry information for assembly house.
ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate.csv            : .csv file output of the above (but generated by google spreadsheets, not excel)
wire_bond_visualizer/                            : example scripts to draw the bond wires on a bond wire diagram for the assembly house
