This directory contains files for handoff to the assembly file.
These are a baseline that was used for our TSMC 180 manycore chip;
you would modify it for your own uses.

Generally, you would start by dialing in your chip pad-ring geometry information
into the .xlsx file.

ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate_calculator.xlsx - calculator for generating wirebond geometry information for assembly house.
ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate.csv             - .csv file output of the above (but generated by google spreadsheets, not excel)
