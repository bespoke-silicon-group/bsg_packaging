This directory contains files for handoff to the assembly ("bond") house, i.e. attaching your die to the BGA substrate
and adding solder bumps on the bottom of the substrate.

These are a baseline that was used for our TSMC 180 manycore chip.

Generally, you would start by dialing in your chip pad-ring geometry information
into the .xlsx file.

To use for your chip:

1. you would modify the Die X and Die Y coordinates for your own pad ring's pads

2. revisit the PLL power domain bonding (marked in red) per your PLL's requirements

3. send the information to your assembly house before you tape out your chip to
   confirm that they can bond it according to your desired bonding pattern. =)

4. after the chips come back, send the chip and the packages to the assembly house.

FILES:

ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate_calculator.xlsx: calculator for generating wirebond geometry information for assembly house.
ucsd_bsg_5x5_bsg_two_to_substrate.csv            : .csv file output of the above (but generated by google spreadsheets, not excel)
wire_bond_visualizer/                            : example scripts to draw the bond wires on a bond wire diagram for the assembly house


Note that in this directory, we refer to misc_L_3 and misc_R_3 as input pins; consistent with the naming scheme when the package was designed.
In bsg_two series chips, these pins are actually outputs, but it does not affect wire bonding.
