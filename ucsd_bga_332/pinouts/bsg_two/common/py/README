This script is used to help generate the tcl files found in ../../<node>/tcl. This script takes in a csv
file where each line is the following:

    Pad Name, Center X Coordinate (in um), Center Y Coordinate (in um), Chip Side [top, bottom, left, right]

The script will take that csv file and create a list of 'set_pin_physcal_constraints' tcl commands
which go in pin_pad_physical_constraints.tcl and a list of 'move_object' tcl commands which go in
pad_move_to_location_file.tcl.
