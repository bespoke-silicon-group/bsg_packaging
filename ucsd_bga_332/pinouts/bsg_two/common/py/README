Porting the Padring to your process / chip design
------------------------------------------------------------

When you resize your chip, or use different pads, which will have different sizes, you will
need to generate a modified pad ring.  Here are some helpful tips.

You want to preserve the centroid location from the middle of the side, and then just move it inward or outward
from the center of the chip in the perpendicular direction. We manually edit the bsg_two_centroid.csv or
bsg_two_centroid_rotate.csv files to do this. 

So for example, in the beginning of the bsg_two_centroid file, here are the first few lines:

padname,center_x,center_y,side
VZZ_L_6,103.5,570,left
V33_L_6,103.5,695,left
VSS_L_16,103.5,820,left
VDD_L_15,103.5,900,left
VSS_L_15,103.5,980,left
VDD_L_14,103.5,1060,left
sdi_B_sclk_ex_i,218.5,1100,left
VZZ_L_5,103.5,1140,left
sdi_B_tkn_ex_o,218.5,1180,left

....

You would be manually editing the 103.5 and 218.5 numbers, which are the distance from the center of the chip. 
You would leave the other numbers alone, since they stay the same relative to the middle of the side.

If your chip is smaller than 5x5, then you start chopping off I/Os from the edges.
Example chops are shown in the bsg_two/common/padring.pdf file.

Alignment of top metal layer and left/right side of padring.
------------------------------------------------------------

Note that bsg_two pinout is asymmetrical by design. Output channels are on top and bottom
and inputs channels are on the sides, to reduce the noise of output channels on the inputs.

Output channels require more I/O VDD pins, so there are fewer available pads available 
for Core VDD on those sides. Additionally, the PLL region reduces the amount of pins for 
supply. So Core VDD supply is more highly concentrated on the left and right side of the
package. In many cases, the top metal layer of a process has thicker metal and much lower 
resistance. So it is preferable to align the top metal layer with the left/right side of 
the package, which might require rotating the chip in the package,
depending on whether top metal runs horizontally or vertically.

See below for example non-rotated and rotated versions.

Pad Ring Creation Scripts for IC Compiler
-----------------------------------------

This script is used to help generate the tcl files for Synopsys IC Compiler found in ../../<node>/tcl. This script takes in a csv
file where each line is the following:

    Pad Name, Center X Coordinate (in um), Center Y Coordinate (in um), Chip Side [top, bottom, left, right]

The script will take that csv file and create a list of 'set_pin_physical_constraints' tcl commands
which go in pin_pad_physical_constraints.tcl and a list of 'move_object' tcl commands which go in
pad_move_to_location_file.tcl.

bsg_two_centroid.csv: chip centered (used for TSMC 250; 5 metal layers)
bsg_two_centroid_rotate.csv: chip rotated  (used for TSMC 180; 6 metal layers)
