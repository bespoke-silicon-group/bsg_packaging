Alignment of top metal layer and left/right side of padring.
---------------------------

Note that bsg_two pinout is asymmetrical by design. Output channels are on top and bottom
and inputs channels are on the sides. Output channels require more I/O VDD pins, so there
are fewer available pads available for Core VDD on those sides. Additionally, the PLL
region reduces the amount of pins for supply. So Core VDD supply is more highly concentrated
on the left and right side of the package. In many cases, the top metal layer of a process
has thicker metal and much lower resistance. So it is preferable to align the top metal layer
with the left/right side of the package, which might require rotating the chip in the package,
depending on whether top metal runs horizontally or vertically.

See below for example non-rotated and rotated versions.

Pad Ring Creation Scripts for IC Compiler
-----------------------------------------

This script is used to help generate the tcl files for Synopsys IC Compiler found in ../../<node>/tcl. This script takes in a csv
file where each line is the following:

    Pad Name, Center X Coordinate (in um), Center Y Coordinate (in um), Chip Side [top, bottom, left, right]

The script will take that csv file and create a list of 'set_pin_physical_constraints' tcl commands
which go in pin_pad_physical_constraints.tcl and a list of 'move_object' tcl commands which go in
pad_move_to_location_file.tcl.

bsg_two_centroid.csv: chip centered (used for TSMC 250; 5 metal layers)
bsg_two_centroid_rotate.csv: chip rotated  (used for TSMC 180; 6 metal layers)
