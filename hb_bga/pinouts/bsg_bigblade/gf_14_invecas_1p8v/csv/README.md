DO NOT MODIFY THESE BY HAND!

These csv files were generated using the script `create_pad_csv.tcl` found
inside the `tcl/` directory and serve as a golden reference.

It is good practice to generate these csv files from your own build and check
them against the golden reference. These files are also used to generate bond
diagrams in the `common/to_assembly_house` directory. You can change the
`FOUNDRY_CSV_DIR` variable in `common/to_assembly_house/Makefile` to point to
the directory with the csv file generated from your build to generate new
diagrams that are not using these golden reference csv files to ensure your
instantiation is correct.
